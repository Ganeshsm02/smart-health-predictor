This Machine Learning project predicts the risk level of four major diseases based on clinical input values provided by the user. It applies trained classification models to analyze patient health parameters and identifies whether the patient is at risk or not at risk.

The four diseases included are:

Diabetes Prediction

Heart Disease Prediction

Kidney Disease Prediction

Liver Disease Prediction

Each disease is predicted independently using its respective ML model trained with real medical datasets.

MODELS 

Diabetes              -  Random Forest Classifier 
Kidney Disease (CKD)  -  Random Forest Classifier 
Heart Disease         -  Random Forest Classifier           
Liver Disease         -  Logistic Regression    

TECHNOLOGIES USED
